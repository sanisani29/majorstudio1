“Fragments: A Comparative World-Wide Analysis”


The questions I wanted to explore with this data set are – 
What do fragments of artifacts that were not recovered tell us about the era they are dated to?
Is there any trend of fragment material being very frequently used and slowly discontinued over time of that material (since perhaps they were more susceptible to fragmentation, and could not sustain as a full object or artifact)?
How does the region / continent affect the materials used, and also affect the type of fragment found?
How can the type of fragment found give us insight about everyday culture of the region? 
How does this everyday culture change over each era for each region? 
How, on a macro level, has use of material changed over the world timeline? Do phenomena like trade and colonization affect materials being transported and adopted for use in other regions?


Data set: “https://www.si.edu/search/collection-images?edan_q=fragments&edan_fq%5B0%5D=place%3A%22Africa%22%20OR%20place%3A%22Asia-Temperate%22%20OR%20place%3A%22Asia-Tropical%22%20OR%20place%3A%22Europe%22&edan_fq%5B1%5D=media_usage%3A%22CC0%22”
(I tried searching on Edan, but it was giving me issues every time I tried to add multiple keywords, or everytime i added the “AND/+AND” command in the overall API URL, saying “no results found”.)

The data set is any result that has “Fragments” in its title or description. The properties available in this data set are “Place (from which i chose the continents)”, “Topic” (material of fragment), “Resource Type” (types of fragments), and “Date” (used to calculate ‘era’). There’s a total of 11,000~ data points that are images of the fragments.


The visualization method used is a Doughnut Chart. This is because “fragments” refer to parts of a whole, so the idea of each doughnut being filled with percentage fragments felt correct, as the form is matching the content being documented.
